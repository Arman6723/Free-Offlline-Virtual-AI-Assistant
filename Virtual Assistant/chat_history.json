The chicken is juicy and flavorful, and the sweet and sour sauce adds a tangy twist to the dish. The crispy pork belly adds a nice texture and a burst of flavor, which pairs well with the sweetness of the sauce. I especially enjoy the sweet and sour sauce on these rice noodle dishes, as it adds a perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess that complements the overall flavor of the dish. I've been trying out different rice noodle dishes lately and this is one of my favorites so far!"
